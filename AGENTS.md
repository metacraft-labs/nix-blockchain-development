# Guidelines for Codex Agents

This repository is a devops environment.

When problems arise with the tooling or dependencies, **do not give up**.
Research the issue online and attempt to resolve it.

You may install additional software either by extending the Nix development
environment or by using the Ubuntu package manager. The primary goal is to
overcome environment issues so that the tooling here works correctly.
