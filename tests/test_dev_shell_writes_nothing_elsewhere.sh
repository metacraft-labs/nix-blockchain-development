# Entering this repository's `ci` dev shell from ANOTHER git repository writes
# nothing into that repository. (`ci` is the shell that installs the git hooks;
# `default` carries none.)
#
# The dev shell's hook installs git hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, hooks
# under `.git/hooks`, `core.hooksPath`). git-hooks.nix aims them at
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` of the CURRENT DIRECTORY, so without a guard
# `nix develop /path/to/this-repo` run from a sibling checkout plants this
# repository's hooks there: an untracked file that blocks that repository's
# pre-push gate, and foreign checks on its commits. flake.nix runs the hook only
# when the enclosing repository is this one (shells/ci.nix).
#
# Asserted, from a scratch git repository and from a subdirectory of it: no
# file or directory appears, no hook is
# installed and `core.hooksPath` is untouched. As the positive control, entered
# from inside this repository the hook still installs `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
